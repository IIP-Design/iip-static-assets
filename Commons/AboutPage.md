## Discover and share public diplomacy content from the U.S. Department of State
The Content Commons is the portal to search and share content from the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Global Public Affairs (GPA).

Share, embed, or download public diplomacy content to use on any channel or website — a campaign, program, or Embassy website, as well as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

## How the Content Commons works
The Content Commons is powered by the Content Distribution Platform (CDP), the backend technology that provides the functionality to index and sync different content types from multiple sources. 

Content is added to the CDP through a plugin or directly uploaded within the platform. This content is then searchable in the Content Commons and the CDP always keeps content up to date by resyncing when changes are made at the source. 

The Content Commons allows users to search, discover, and share content from a variety of different sources and content types. Currently the Content Commons contains videos and articles with plans to add images, PDFs, audio, and more.

The Content Commons makes finding and sharing public diplomacy content a better experience, to reach more people, tailor content to your audiences, and increase the influence of your content.

## About GPA
The Bureau of Global Public Affairs (GPA) belongs to the State Department’s [public diplomacy](https://www.state.gov/r/index.htm) (PD) family of bureaus, where it provides highly impactful content to PD practitioners and foreign publics to advance American foreign policy goals.

GPA supports people-to-people conversations with foreign publics on U.S. policy priorities. To carry out this mission, the bureau leverages digital communications technology to reach across platforms - from traditional forms of communications to new media channels.

Whether discussions take place in person or in virtual spaces, the bureau’s top goal is to connect people with policy through dialogue that is relatable and understandable.
