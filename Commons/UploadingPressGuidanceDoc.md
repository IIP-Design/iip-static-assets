## Uploading Press Guidance

### Gather Files
Before getting started with a new package, gather all files and have them ready for upload.

Quick Tip: It helps to have all the files in the same folder. This allows you to easily find them all in one location when uploading.

### Creating a New Guidance Package
1. Click the **upload button icon** at the top right hand side of the browser window. It is the icon that looks like a cloud with an upward pointing arrow. This will bring you to Upload Content Screen.

2. Select **Create New Package** on the Upload Content Screen.

Confirm Package Details and agree to terms to **Save draft & upload files**.

This will launch the file explorer where you can select the files you wish to upload. Only **Microsoft Word Documents** will be accepted for this type of document upload.

- Make sure that the files you are uploading are in agreement with our [Terms of Use](https://commons.america.gov/about "Terms of Use") and that you have the rights and permissions to upload the files. If you are unsure of this please reach out to [your supervisor, director, ect] for guidance.

- We recommend naming your files descriptively using the titles of the releases, ex: `international_human_rights_day.docx`, to help pre-populate metadata fields and save time when uploading.

3. Add Metadata (Release Type, Lead Bureaus, etc.) for Prepared Files

    Step 1: Add Metadata for each of the files you have uploaded.

5. At the top right of the Package Details page, you have three options:

     - **Delete Package**: Will delete the package and all files within it
    - **Save & Exit**: Will save the package and the uploaded files as draft, not visible on Content Commons
    - **Publish**: Will publish the package and all uploaded files

6. On the Package Details page, fill in the remaining required metadata in order to complete your file upload and guidance package.
