## Overview

GPA is excited to share the news of the modernized Content Commons 2.0 utilizing the Aprimo platform expected to launch early winter 2022. Content Commons 2.0 will be replacing the existing Content Commons as the central repository for all content to be consumed by the PD Community. The decision to upgrade the existing Content Commons by upgrading the platform not only ensures GPA is properly equipping you as the PD Community with tools that are best-in-class for content creation opportunities but also tools that can be tailored to engage and inform PD Community’s key target audiences.

## Background

Content Commons is a cloud-based content management custom solution that GPA developed for the GPA PD Community as a central repository for all content to be consumed by the PD community. Content Commons contains a public-facing website where the public and PD practitioners can access different content (graphics, videos, documents) from different sources and share the content. There is also an internal website which is protected via OKTA authentication, where only state.gov and other approved users can log in and see all the content from the public-facing website but also see additional content marked as internal only (graphics, videos, Press Guidance Packages, and Playbooks).

## Talking Points

- **What's wrong with the current Content Commons?**
  - Nothing is wrong with the current Content Commons that should concern anyone. We are always working and developing ways of enhancing GPA’s ability to create and distribute content in a timely manner to fully engage our key target audiences.
- **Why is GPA upgrading to Content Commons 2.0?**
  - GPA is upgrading Content Commons with the new platform to better position GPA in providing more capabilities to PD Practitioners faster and more efficiently.
  - Content Commons 2.0 will empower GPA with additional opportunities to better serve the needs of the PD practitioners that the current platform did not.
  - Content Commons 2.0 will allow GPA to create and distribute content that is timely, data-informed, and tailored to engage and inform key target audiences.
- **Who decided we needed to upgrade the existing Content Commons?**
  - GPA/DIG conducted an in-depth user research and market analysis of multiple platform options with representative members of the PD community during the first half of 2022, and the chosen platform was based on feedback received from our PD practitioners.
- **What will happen to all the content currently on the existing Content Commons that I access and use daily?**
  - GPA/DIG is working with the different office stakeholders to identify which of their respective content is relevant and necessary as part of the migration, all other content will be archived appropriately.
- **What will happen to the content that might not be migrated over?**
  - If content is identified that is no longer relevant/necessary, GPA/DIG will work with the content owner to identify the proper archival path, and archived content will remain available to PD practitioners.
- **Will there be any differences in the way I access Content Commons to perform my job in relation to the upgrade?**
  - For accessing Content Commons 2.0, there will be a new URL that will be communicated to the field prior to the go live. As the upgrade to Content Commons 2.0 progresses there will be more information communicated regarding this.
  - For logging into Content Commons 2.0 to access content marked as internal only, Content Commons 2.0 will still be using OKTA for login/user management. GPA/DIG is also providing the list of users and their permission level so no one should have to ‘re-enroll’ to get access.
  - For publishing/uploading content to Content Commons 2.0, GPA/DIG has documented the current workflows and page configurations and is providing this information to the team performing the migration and configuration of Content Commons 2.0 to ensure as best as possible the workflows are the same as it is on the current Content Commons. GPA/DIG will be announcing training sessions as we move closer to the go live date that will cover any potential workflow differences.
  - GPA/DIG plans to host meetings with Office Stakeholders to demonstrate any deviations from the existing functionality as well as provide new user guides to describe the process.
- **What impact will this have on the public or NGOs that use the current Content Commons?**
  - There will be little to no impact on the public who access Content Commons. The plan is for the public to access and consume content the same way with Content Commons 2.0 as they do with the existing Content Commons.
- **How will I know when Content Commons has been upgraded to Content Commons 2.0?**
  - GPA/DIG has a cadence schedule of announcements via multiple channels (Slack, Cables, GoogleMeet) with the PD Practitioners to convey status updates and upcoming milestones throughout the implementation phase.
  - There will be more detailed information provided to the Office Stakeholders as the process moves along.
