## Uploading a Video to Content Commons

### Gather Files
Before getting started with a video project, gather all the associated files and have them ready for upload.

Quick Tip: It helps to have all the files in the same folder. This allows you to easily find them all in one place. 

### Login to Content Commons
Navigate to https://commons.america.gov/login to access your account and Dashboard. If you do not have a user profile, see How to Create a User Profile.

### Creating a New Video Project
1. Click the **upload button icon** at the top right hand side of the browser window. It is the icon that looks like a cloud with an upward pointing arrow. This will bring you to Upload Content Screen.

- Make sure that the videos and files you are uploading are in agreeance with our Terms of Use and that you have the rights and permissions to upload the files.

- We recommend naming your files descriptively using keywords or languages, ex: `project-title_arabic.mp4`, to help pre-populate metadata fields and save time when uploading.
