## Gather Files
Before getting started with a video project, gather all the associated files and have them ready for upload.

Quick Tip: It helps to have all the files in the same folder. This allows you to easily find them all in one place. 

## Login to Content Commons
Navigate to https://commons.america.gov/login to access your account and Dashboard. If you do not have a user profile, see How to Create a User Profile.

## Creating a New Video Project

    This will launch the file explorer where you can select the files you wish to upload. **Video projects must contain at least one video file (.mp4 and .mov)**. Other acceptable file types: .srt for captions, .jpg or .png for thumbnails.

    - Make sure that the videos and files you are uploading are in agreeance with our Terms of Use and that you have the rights and permissions to upload the files.
