## What is the Content Commons?

The Content Commons is the portal to search, discover, and share content from the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP).

## Who manages the Content Commons?

The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP) manages the Content Commons, Content Publisher, and Content Distribution Platform (CDP).

## Where do I start?

Getting started is easy! Head to content.america.gov and start searching and browsing content. Also, make sure to check out our user guide and quick tutorial video so that you can start leveraging the Content Commons right from the start.

## Where can I find information on how to use the Content Commons?

Take a look at our user guide and quick tutorial video for getting started on the Content Commons. As new features get added, we will have more guides and videos available.

## What types of content can I find or store in the Commons?

Currently, only videos are available in the Content Commons from sites that have installed the Content Distribution Platform (CDP) plugin. However, we are working on adding articles, courses, audio, PDFs, and more.

## Why are there only videos in Content Commons?

The video content type is our first minimum viable product (MVP) for the Content Commons. While we will include more content like articles, courses, and imagery in the future, the video MVP was the most important content type to include first to make videos accessible and downloadable in the field. 

## Why can't I embed these videos on my site?

**TODO**

## Can anyone add content to the Commons?

We are currently indexing sites from the Department of State, and only Department of State staff can use the Content Publisher to add content. However, if you are interested in indexing your site or using the Content Publisher, contact [design@america.gov](mailto:design@america.gov).

## How do I share content from the Commons?

You can download content directly from the Commons. Just click “download” on the piece of content. We are working on adding the ability to share content directly on your website by creating and copying an embed code. We are also adding features to share content through Facebook or Twitter directly from the Commons.

## Is content available in my language?

Currently the Content Commons features content available in the following languages: **TODO**. Not all pieces of content are available in every language.

## How can I contact IIP for support?

If you have any questions, please contact [design@america.gov](mailto:design@america.gov).

## What happens to my content hosted on other properties when I delete it?

Content that has been added to other sites through an embed code or Content Commons Plugin will automatically update upon removal of that content. However, any content that has been saved locally and update to a site will not be removed.

## What are upcoming features or updates for the Content Commons?

We are working on adding additional content types, including articles, audio, PDFs, quizzes, and more. We are also adding additional features, starting with the ability to share content on other channels or by creating an embed code. Eventually, we will add additional features like user profiles, analytics, and more. To contact us about adding additional features or for more information on updates, send an email to [design@america.gov](mailto:design@america.gov).
