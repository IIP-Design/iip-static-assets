## Content Commons

### What is the Content Commons?

The Content Commons is the portal to search, discover, and share content from the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP).

### Who manages the Content Commons?

The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP) manages the Content Commons, Content Publisher, and Content Distribution Platform (CDP).

### Where do I start?

Getting started is easy! Head to content.america.gov and start searching and browsing content.

### What types of content can I find or store in the Commons?

Currently, only videos are available in the Content Commons from sites that have installed the Content Distribution Platform (CDP) plugin. However, we are working on adding articles, courses, audio, PDFs, and more.

### Can anyone add content to the Commons?

We are currently indexing sites from the Department of State, and only Department of State staff can use the Content Publisher to add content. However, if you are interested in indexing your site or using the Content Publisher, contact [design@america.gov](mailto:design@america.gov).

### How do I share content from the Commons?

You can download content directly from the Commons. Just click “download” on the piece of content. We are working on adding the ability to share content directly on your website by creating and copying an embed code. We are also adding features to share content through Facebook or Twitter directly from the Commons.

### Is content available in my language?

Currently the Content Commons features content available in the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Bahasa Indonesia, Portuguese, Arabic, Farsi, Russian, and Urdu. Note: Not all pieces of content are available in every language. 

### How can I contact IIP for support?

If you have any questions, please contact [design@america.gov](mailto:design@america.gov).

### What are upcoming features or updates for the Content Commons?

We are working on adding additional content types, including articles, audio, PDFs, quizzes, and more. We are also adding additional features, starting with the ability to share content on other channels or by creating an embed code. Eventually, we will add additional features like user profiles, analytics, and more. To contact us about adding additional features or for more information on updates, send an email to [design@america.gov](mailto:design@america.gov).

## CDP

### What is the Content Distribution Platform (CDP)?

The CDP is a plugin to index content from a website into the CDP, so that it can be synced on other properties, as well as found and shared in the Content Commons.

### How do I install the CDP plugin?

If you are interesting in installing the CDP plugin on your website to begin indexing your content, contact [design@america.gov](mailto:design@america.gov).

### What happens to content that has been indexed when I change or delete it?

When you update content that is being indexed by the CDP, the changes are automatically reflected in the Content Commons and any other website or property that is hosting your content. If you delete content, it will be deleted in the Content Commons and any sites hosting content through the CDP.
